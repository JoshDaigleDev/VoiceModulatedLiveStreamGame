# Welcome to my voice controlled obstacle game!


This is a project I made for someone who streams themselves singing on TikTok live. You move the player using your voice. It uses the TikTok live API to track events such as likes, follows, and donations to trigger different events during the game, such as shooting the laser cannon. This was my first attempt at building a project using Python, and it was a great learning experience! 

All art done by me.
